    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Beef</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Sour cream</li>
        <li>Beans</li>
        <li>Tortilla</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over high heat. Add garlic and onion, 
            cook for 2 minutes until onion is lightly browned. Add beef 
            and cook, breaking it up as you go, until it turns from red 
            to brown.</li>
        <li>Add Taco Seasoning (or use 1 packet store bought) and cook 
            for 1 minute. Then add tomato paste and water, cook for 3 
            minutes until the water is mostly evaporated but the beef 
            is still juicy, not dried out. Set aside to cool for 10 
            minutes piping hot filling will steam the burrito, making 
            the tortilla soggy.</li>
        <li>Optional: If not warming rolled burrito, warm the tortillas
            before rolling (per packet directions).</li>
        <li>Place a burrito on a work surface. Place 1/4 - 1/3 cup of 
            rice just below the centre. Top with 1/4 - 1/3 cup beef, then
            some lettuce, corn, black beans, tomato,  a sprinkle of red onion,
            coriander and cheese.</li>
        <li>Fold up the bottom to cover the filling then fold the edges in 
            (video helpful to see how to do this). Roll up tightly, then wrap 
            in foil. Serve as is or heat per below.</li>
        <li>HEATING: To warm through, pan fry (dry pan) in the foil over medium
            high heat for a few minutes on each side to slightly crisp and warm
            the outside. Or for 10+ minutes on a medium low heat if you want to 
            melt the cheese. Or they can be baked at 180C/350F for 20 minutes 
            in the foil this will warm them all the way through and crisp up 
            the tortilla slightly. If they are straight from the fridge, they 
            will take around 30 minutes to warm through.</li>
        <li>Burritos are best served with something to dollop/dip - sour cream
             (or yoghurt) and some sort of chilli sauce are my usual because it's
              easy. When I'm making more of an effort, I use  Restaurant Style
               Salsa or Guacamole.</li>
    </ol>
